Shortcomings of the Current Version:
1. Immature Ecosystem: Carbon is still in early stages; libraries and frameworks are sparse.
2. Limited Community Support: Smaller developer base compared to mature languages like Rust or C++.
3. Concurrency Support: Currently underdeveloped for modern multi-threaded workloads.
4. Tooling: IDE support and debugging tools are limited, requiring manual setups.
