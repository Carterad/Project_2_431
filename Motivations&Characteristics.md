## Motivations:

**"Successor Language" to C++:** Improve upon C++ by providing a modern, safer, and more efficient development experience.

**Interoperability:** Allow seamless migration from C++ rather than replacing it outright.

**Performance:** Maintain high-performance characteristics, critical in systems programming.

## Characteristics:

**Paradigms:**

- Multi-paradigm (Procedural, Functional, Object-Oriented, etc.)
- Strong focus on systems programming.

**Typing Discipline:**

- Static typing with type inference.
- Emphasis on safety and performance without sacrificing flexibility.

**Notable Features:**

- Seamless interop with existing C++ codebases.
- Advanced generics for code reuse.
- Modular design for scalability.
- Improved memory safety compared to C++.
