Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
Carbon is still in an experimental phase, and its setup typically involves building from source.

Steps:
Install WSL and Set Up Ubuntu (if not already done):

Open PowerShell and execute:
bash

wsl --install
Install the latest Ubuntu distribution if not already configured.
Install Prerequisites:

Update the package list:
bash

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Install essential tools:
bash

sudo apt install cmake clang gcc g++ git python3 python3-pip build-essential -y
Clone the Carbon Repository:

Clone the Carbon repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang.git
cd carbon-lang
Build Carbon:

Run the build process using CMake:
bash

cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
cmake --build build
Verify the build by running tests:
bash

cd build
./carbon_tests

Using Docker:
While no official Docker image is available, you can create one by writing a Dockerfile to set up the Carbon environment. For example:

dockerfile

FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt update && apt install -y \
    clang \
    cmake \
    git \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    build-essential

WORKDIR /carbon-lang
RUN git clone https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang.git .

RUN cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ && \
    cmake --build build
